                <p>I could have left this one blank, it would have been so much easier. Hell I still might. I’ll probably come up with an even better ethical decision I had to make in a month from now and remember whatever crap I wrote here. I guess either perseverance or maybe creativity is a value of mine because my ethical decision seems to be wether or not I leave this blank.</p>
                <p>I choose not to.</p>
                <p>I am good at remaining patient when things aren’t going as fast I might like them to. There’s usually not a need to rush, and work can be done at the pace it needs. Also I can easily take changes as they come, quickly adapting if things need to be altered with little forewarning.</p>
                <p>Unless it’s maths or there’s only one right answer, it is difficult for me to get going or even keep going after that. This document is a perfect example of that. It took me two days of nothing and now today it’s all coming naturally. I’m not sure where the right headspace is for this, but hitting it is difficult and seemingly random. Once it hits though, tasks will be done. One would hope this wouldn’t get too far in the way of other writing tasks, but it may very well.</p>
                <p>Once when I was in primary school we had an assignment to make a board game. Me and another girl, Holly, decided to make a dinosaur game. It was simple, you rolled dice and moved spaces and hoped you didn’t land on a hazard. It would have been absolutely fine had I not continuously been ignoring her ideas in favour of my own. Even after trying to tell me I wouldn’t budge so she eventually moved on to another group’s game. I’m glad this happened then since after this I have been more willing to prioritise my own ideas over others even if I think they’re better. All the best ideas in the world mean nothing without anyone to share them with.</p>
