                <ol>
                  <li><h3>What is my long term goal or career pathway?</h3></li>
                  <p>I’ve never had much of a career pathway, or indeed a long term goal. I have so many things I want to do, but so little time to do them. I’ve always wanted it to be something programming or at least computer related. But what? My ultimate goal now I think is game development, but it’s hard to get into. Web development may be more doable, or potentially other kinds of programming.</p>

                  <li><h3>What are my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</h3></li>
                  <p>I’m good at getting through problems. I know how to find information that will help in solving issues and how to apply it without needing to ask for external help. Usually anyhow…</p>

                  <p>I do tend to be resistant to failure no matter how small, unless I find I can learn something from it. This can lead to avoiding things I should be doing and potentially falling behind in learning.</p>

                  <li><h3>What human skills would I like to develop while at DevAcademy?</h3></li>
                  <p>I’m not sure. Networking potentially? That’s always been one that eludes me...</p>

                  <li><h3>How will I manage my workload?</h3></li>
                  <p>Don’t do too much, take breaks, plan ahead if there’s something I have to do with others.<br>If it’s all coming to a head and becoming too much then perhaps a day of rest, if that doesn’t cause everything to pile up. If I have to I can caht with the Facilitators about this.</p>

                  <li><h3>How and where will I seek help in a timely way?</h3></li>
                  <p>If I’m absolutely stuck and it seems there is an obvious solution there is the discord I can ask about in.</p>

                  <li><h3>What do I expect from the Facilitation team?</h3></li>
                  <p>Listening and giving feedback and help where it’s needed. Not much more I can ask</p>

                  <li><h3>Do I have schedule conflicts?</h3></li>
                  <p>So far I have nothing conflicting, except maybe Friday nights, but I expect nothing to conflict with that.</p>
                </ol>

                <h2>Learning Plan (Bootcamp)</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><h3>What is my long term goal or career pathway?</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        The skills I learn here I hope to use to further my own programming skills. Hopefully I can learn more programming and perhaps improve my game development possibilities. I also hope to be able to get myself a job in web development in the mean time so I can pay for the important things in the mean time.
                    </p>

                    <li><h3>What are my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</h3></li>
                    <p>I don't believe this has changed since Foundations. Problem solving good, Failure bad.</p>

                    <li><h3>What human skills would I like to develop while at Bootcamp?</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        Pairing with others perhaps. While I can work fine, the initial contact eludes me.
                    </p>

                    <li><h3>What do I expect from the Bootcamp team?</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        Same as always, very little. Support where need like if I have to know what I’m doing wrong. In general just very people stuff.
                    </p>

                    <li><h3>What are my expectations of myself at Bootcamp?</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        Do the mahi, get the results. Understand what I’m doing. Get things done and do them better than is necessary.
