                  <li>What is my long term goal or career pathway?</li>
                  <p>I’ve never had much of a career pathway, or indeed a long term goal. I have so many things I want to do, but so little time to do them. I’ve always wanted it to be something programming or at least computer related. But what? My ultimate goal now I think is game development, but it’s hard to get into. Web development may be more doable, or potentially other kinds of programming.</p>
                  <li>What are my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</li>
                  <p>I’m good at getting through problems. I know how to find information that will help in solving issues and how to apply it without needing to ask for external help. Usually anyhow…</p>
                  <p>I do tend to be resistant to failure no matter how small, unless I find I can learn something from it. This can lead to avoiding things I should be doing and potentially falling behind in learning.</p>
                  <li>What human skills would I like to develop while at DevAcademy?</li>
                  <p>I’m not sure. Networking potentially? That’s always been one that eludes me...</p>
                  <li>How will I manage my workload?</li>
                  <p>Don’t do too much, take breaks, plan ahead if there’s something I have to do with others.<br>If it’s all coming to a head and becoming too much then perhaps a day of rest, if that doesn’t cause everything to pile up. If I have to I can caht with the Facilitators about this.</p>
                  <li>How and where will I seek help in a timely way?</li>
                  <p>If I’m absolutely stuck and it seems there is an obvious solution there is the discord I can ask about in.</p>
                  <li>What do I expect from the Facilitation team?</li>
                  <p>Listening and giving feedback and help where it’s needed. Not much more I can ask</p>
                  <li>Do I have schedule conflicts?</li>
                  <p>So far I have nothing conflicting, except maybe Friday nights, but I expect nothing to conflict with that.</p>
