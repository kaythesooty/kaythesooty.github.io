                <h2>JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM)</h2>
                <!--<br>-->
                <h3>Okay I'll bite. What's this whole "JavaScript" about. What does it have to do with HTML and CSS?</h3>
                <p>What if you built a robot one day. You start with the skeleton, the bare minimum to make it begin to look like a robot (this is the html). You then add all the details and such to make it look exactly how you wanted! That’s the css. It’s great right? Wrong, sir! Wrong! Your robot is lousy and does nothing! But… how do we make it do something? We add internal components that make it move, compute, and do other robot things. That, mein freund, is the JavaScript. The components of our robot that make it do the cool things we want it to.</p>

                <h3>Okay but what's control flow? Why is that important?</h3>
                <p>Control flow is really tricky. Imagine you have a list of tasks and – wait it gets worse – you have to do them… IN ORDER! (dun dun duhhhhh…) So yeah, control flow is just doing things in order, which is usually just top to bottom. You can change the order with instructions sometimes, like if you gotta repeat something, the next thing to do after you did the thing is to do it again. That’s called a loop btw. Like carrying bricks from stack a to stack b. You don’t just go to the next task after one go through, you gotta keep going back to the beginning, grab more bricks, back to stack b, stack them, then loop back and on and on!</p>

                <h3>Loops? Brøther may I have some løøps?</h3>
                <p>You can also use loops for something like idk checking your undies for holes. You might get them all out and line them up. Then you say “I’m going to start from the first one, go until I’ve reached the end, and once I’ve checked one I’ll move onto the next one”. You do that, and each time you get to one you check for holes. If you find holes, you throw that pair out, otherwise you move on.</p>

                <h3>Okay I get it. But uhh... what's this 'DOM'? It's not umm... well, you know...</h3>
                <p>Well the DOM is uh… probably not what you’re thinking. It stands for Doument Object Model, which might sound complicated, but it’s not really. The ‘Document’ is the whole webpage, with all the html and css, a fancy word for ‘everything’ essentially. The ‘Object’ part is because JavaScript likes to work with “objects”. It’s basically just the html but in a language that JavaScript can work with. And the ‘model’ part? Well uh…</p>

                <p>You can do lots of things by manipulating the DOM with JavaScript, like replace the background colours, or the text colours. You can get rid of stuff, or change it’s positioning. If you know what you’re doing, you can even make entirely new bits of page! So much potential!</p>

                <h3>I've heard about arrays and objects before, what can you tell me about them?</h3>
                <p>An array is the easier thing. It’s just a long string of things, can be anything; numbers, words, variables, you name it. To get things out of it, you just say which array you want data out of and attach a number to it. The computer then goes through all the entries until it finds the one with your number on it, then gives it to you.</p>

                <p>Objects are a little more complicated but not so much. It’s like an array, but you can name the entries. It's harder to get things out of too since you need to turn things into an array first, then follow the instructions for getting stuff out of an array.</p>

                <h3>What have the functions ever done for us!?</h3>
                <p>You know what I want? I want some flour, and eggs, and sugar, and baking powder all mixed into one and baked and then spread with some kind of cream cheese on top! Yeah or I could say I want a cake. I don’t need to keep specifying what I want to happen to ingredients if I have the word cake to describe it for me. That's a function, a set of instructions contained in a neat little word-sized package.</p>
