                    <li>
                        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h3>
                        <p>
                            I learned just how proud I am sometimes. How many times do I think “Aha, I found this easy when you didn’t >:3”. I’m not stupid enough to go believing anything like that though. The thought passes eventually.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I definitely learned how shutting up is a good thing maybe. As before mentioned, you don’t want to go saying the wrong thing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now I have learned just how many three actually is. It can seem like a lot when you have so little to say.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                        <p>
                            You’re gonna have your code looked at by others so it needs to be readable. Gotta put yourself in others shoes to see what would be helpful and what would be confusing. And if someone isn’t understanding something, the worst thing you can do is to just think they’re stupid and hopeless and who cares about them.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
                        <p>
                            How dang hard it actually is. There were meant to be a couple other blog posts. They are um… decidedly incomplete. Perhaps it has to do with the right answer being so elusive, rather than with programming where the answer is “Does it work right? Yes? No problem.”
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h3>
                        <p>
                            All the writing. Especially on parts where I don’t have the answer to a question asked. It’s the same with all types of writing like this. There seem to be hidden answers as well, you need to continue the answer to some weird conclusion that isn’t written out. Or I’m being paranoid who knows.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
                        <p>
                            It’s been mentioned that human skills are important in getting a job as employers aren’t looking for the best coder, but the best person who is a coder.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                        <p>
                            I really can’t say that prompting some thinking is a waste of time. While programming would be my preferred subject to focus more on and it certainly would be easier, a bit of other things aren’t wasting my time.
