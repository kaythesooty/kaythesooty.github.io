                Problem solving? It’s basically the first thing you learn while programming. Well that and hello world, but we’re not talking about that. Programming is all about problem solving. Ever hear of debuggin? Yeah you guessed it, problem solving. You make cade you’ll undoubtedly need to solve some problems. Sometimes these problems can be incredibly simple.

                For instanct one time I was trying to figure out why one way wasn’t working, but another way was. If I gave my function a string to pass through it would act as if there was nothing there, however if I defined it in the function it was fine. I poured over it for at least 20 minutes, running through it, searching through documentation as to why such a thing could be. And then while running over it in extreme detail yet again I realised… I wasn’t passing a string to the function, but a variable. A variable that didn’t exist. From then on I have been quite careful to make sure my strings are indeed strings.

                There are many ways to solve problems, and programming is all about solving problems. Some of these I have been familiar with for a long time: Reading error messages and googling them is probably the easiest way to do it, as it’ll often tell you exactly what’s wrong. If that’s not an option then just googling what’s going on can also yield useful results. If there’s not much else you can simply try stuff and see if it works. 40% of the time, it works every time.

                Some methods are relatively new to me, although similar to things I’ve done in the past: Console logging (also called console.logging) is a very versatile way to debug, from seeing what things are outputting or whether things are doing what you want them to. There’s also pseudocode, which is kind of writing down what you want to code but in plain english. Doesn’t have to be English I guess but that’s what we’re using here so it’s a much better idea than trying to pseudocode in Icelandic so that nobody knows what you’re saying (except of course Icelanders). The rubber ducky method is one I’ve heard about in the past. It’s called so because one tries to walk through their code and explain it to a rubber ducky. While the rubber ducky does not have to be that exactly, so long as you’re going through the action of explaining the code. It has saved me many times in the past.

                Lastly when all else fails, you can ask for help. There are forums like stack overflow, and for me at least at this time, I have the DevAcademy discord. As far as helpful methods go, this is the one that is most likely to give results. The expertise of others is the most reliable. Admittedly I’m ready for this step quite yet, but if something were to stump me long enough I would be willing to. I nearly got to this point a while back while trying to figure out why I was getting an error that seemed completely out of place. In the end I figured it out by reading through the documentation again and realising a part I had missed. Everything worked fine after that.
