                <h2>The differences between Relative, Fixed, and Absolute positioning in CSS</h2>
                <!--<br>-->
                <p>Relative, Fixed, and Absolute positioning are all values of the same css property: position. This controls what else, but how an element’s position varies on a webpage. The default is static, which is what you see on every page. It’s part of the page, it scrolls up and down, it never moves from its spot. But what if it did move? That’s where our three values come in.</p>
                <p>Relative is very sympathetic. It joins with the rest of the document and sees itself from its origin as everything else does… it’s just a little out of place. Relative moves an element depending on what you set, like <code>top: 30px;</code> or <code>left: 69px;</code>. So instead of our element being in its normal place, it will be 30 pixels up and 69 to the left, but everything else will act as if it’s still in its usual spot. Nice.</p>
                <p>Absolute however cares little for the other elements on the page. It hides away on top of them, and they don’t even make room for it. How lonesome! But that’s just the way Absolute is. Like with relative, it’ll move based on values you give it like <code>bottom: 4px; right: 20px;</code> but instead of moving from its origin position in the document (since it doesn’t have one), it moves based on its parent element. If it’s inside a box, it’ll start in the top left of the box and go 4 pixels down and 20 pixels right. And yes, it will respect the padding rules of its parent. It does care you know.</p>
                <p>Fixed is much the same as absolute, caring none for the rest of the page. But fixed is assertive and aggressive. Instead of hiding in its little spot under its parent, it stands proud in a place that’s dictated only based on the viewport. And it’ll stay right there, no scrolling allowed. Legends say it was inspired by the great Head Up Displays of old video games, like DOOM, Quake, and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.</p>
                <p>So in the end, if these three positions were in a fight, who would win? The answer is the same as it has been for millenia.</p>
                <p>It depends on what they’re fighting for.</p>
