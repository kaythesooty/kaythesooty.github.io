    <h2>Where am I?</h2>
    <p>This is the index page for my development blogs. While it may be barebones at the moment, one day it'll contain links to blogs and other pages that I'll be making during my foundations work at DevAcademy. This will be viewable on all devices, and should scale around to fit them. Click/tap the links to go to that blog.</p>

    <h2>Blog List</h2>
    <h3 id="te-houtaewa-template"><a href="blog/te-houtaewa-template.html">The Story of Te Houtaewa</a></h3>
    <p>The story of Te Houtaewa is a tale of trickery and cunning. Probably. I only have a small part of it but that seems about right from what I've got. Mainly it's a test for things. Like linking.</p>
